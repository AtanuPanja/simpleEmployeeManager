# simpleEmployeeManager

This is a C program to manage details of three employees(just for this program, even more can be handled too).

Everytime a new memory location is allocated for storing id of the Employee and immediately deallocated after printing the id (all at runtime of the program).

It basically works on the concept of *dynamic allocation and reallocation of memory from the heap at the runtime*, which is quite a powerful tool in C language.
